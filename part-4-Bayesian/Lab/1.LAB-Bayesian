Bayesian Networks

1- Download the files of the DDoS dataset (both test and train).
	All files have 10000 instances, and their names indicate N(ormal)-A(ttack) distribution.

2- Open weka and configure the test to use the supplied set DDoS_test

3- Run NaiveBayes for each of the DDoS_train datasets.

	WHICH TRAIN DATASET HAD THE BEST RESULT? WHY?

4- Run BayesNet with the 3 train datasets. The results are more similar. 

	WHAT IS THE CAUSE FOR SUCH BEHAVIOR?
