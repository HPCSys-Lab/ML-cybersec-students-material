Association Rules

2- Go to Associate tab and run Apriori on this dataset.
	How many rules were created?
10 rules were created. 

3- Open the algorithm parameters (click on 'Apriori -N 10..') and change the parameter 'lowerBoundMinSupport' to 0.8 and run it again.
	How many rules were created this time? Why?
This time, only 7 rules were created. The reason is that increasing the minimum support by just 0.1 means that the rule has to appear on at least 80% of the instances.
If increased to 0.9 only 2 rules will be shown. The ones which appeared in 100% of instances.

4- Even with this modification in the parameters, the rules created seem dull.
	e.g
	1. J=FALSE 10 ==> I=FALSE 10    <conf:(1)> lift:(1) lev:(0) [0] conv:(0)
	2. I=FALSE 10 ==> J=FALSE 10    <conf:(1)> lift:(1) lev:(0) [0] conv:(0)
	3. C=FALSE 8 ==> I=FALSE 8    <conf:(1)> lift:(1) lev:(0) [0] conv:(0)
	4. C=FALSE 8 ==> J=FALSE 8    <conf:(1)> lift:(1) lev:(0) [0] conv:(0)
	Rule 1 and 2 are the exact same thing.
	Do you imagine what will happen if we use lowerBound=0.3 and upperBound=0.5 this time?

Only rules that appeared in at least 3 instances and at most 5 instances will appear. The maximum limit is 100.
You can try for different values, but remember that WEKA shows the most rules with the maximum support first.
