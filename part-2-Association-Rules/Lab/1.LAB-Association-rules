Association Rules

1- Open the file transactions.arff on weka.
	This is a simple file that has examples of transactions that should be tested to find the frequent itemsets.
	It has 12 attributes with boolean values indicating this item was present in the transaction.

2- Go to Associate tab and run Apriori on this dataset.
	How many rules were created?

3- Open the algorithm parameters (click on 'Apriori -N 10..') and change the parameter 'lowerBoundMinSupport' to 0.8 and run it again.
	How many rules were created this time? Why?
	What will happen if we increase by 0.1 again (making Minimum support = 0.9)?

4- Even with this modification in the parameters, the rules created seem dull.
	e.g
	1. J=FALSE 10 ==> I=FALSE 10    <conf:(1)> lift:(1) lev:(0) [0] conv:(0)
	2. I=FALSE 10 ==> J=FALSE 10    <conf:(1)> lift:(1) lev:(0) [0] conv:(0)
	3. C=FALSE 8 ==> I=FALSE 8    <conf:(1)> lift:(1) lev:(0) [0] conv:(0)
	4. C=FALSE 8 ==> J=FALSE 8    <conf:(1)> lift:(1) lev:(0) [0] conv:(0)
	Rule 1 and 2 are the exact same thing.
	Do you imagine what will happen if we use lowerBound=0.3, upperBound=0.5 and numRules=100 this time?

5- You can play with the dataset votes.arff that is packaged together with WEKA.
	The .arff file has the description of the dataset.
